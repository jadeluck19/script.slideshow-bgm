** 2. Hook up with skin
*slideshow-BGM* is expected to run only while slideshowing. One simple way to do so is hooking up slideshow-BGM script to slideshow window(SlideShow.xml).
You can do it by manually editing ~SlideShow.xml~ file or running '~hookup.py~' script included in the slideshow-BGM package.

*** Manual editing 
    - It is easy and straightforward. Just locate the ~SlideShow.xml~ file of your current skin; open it  with your favorite text editor; and insert one line of xml codes as below:

*Note:* You will need root/Administrator privilege if you are using the default skin(as of Kodi v18 Leia, estuary).
*** Use =hookup.py= script
    - If you don't like to edit manually for any reason, you can alternatively use '~hookup.py~' script. ~hookup.py~ resides in =<user addon directory>/addons/script.slideshow-BGM/resources/lib/=, but the location of '/<user addon directory>/' varies depending on OS.
For instance:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 On Linux,  /home/USERNAME/.kodi
 On Windows, C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Kodi
#+END_EXAMPLE

    - Locate ~hookup.py~ and run it.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
cd path-to-directory-containing-hookup.py
python hookup.py
# Or if root/Administrator privilege required
sudo python hookup.py
#+END_EXAMPLE

** 3. Configure
The last step is to choose yor BGM. Go to the configure screen of slideshow-BGM and select a playlist or a directory which contains music. If you choose a directory, slideshow-BGM will create a playlist in [[https://kodi.wiki/view/Userdata#addon_data][addon_data folder]]. That's it. Enjoy!

** Troubleshooting
*** slideshow-BGM keeps playing the same music from the beginnig
In most cases, this happens due to corrupted or abnormaly encoded audio files. They seem to fail SeekTime function of kodi which use ffmpeg/libav internally; and SeekTime() ends up on time 0, the beginnig of the file. Take a look at the example below:

**** A sample audio file
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
ffprobe version 4.2.4 Copyright (c) 2007-2020 the FFmpeg developers
Input #0, mp3, from 'sample.mp3':
  Metadata:
    major_brand     : 3gp4
    minor_version   : 512
    compatible_brands: isomiso23gp4
    encoder         : Lavf58.20.100
  Duration: 00:04:22.94, start: 0.138122, bitrate: 15 kb/s
    Stream #0:0: Audio: mp3, 8000 Hz, mono, fltp, 8 kb/s
    Stream #0:1: Video: mjpeg (Baseline), yuvj420p(pc, bt470bg/unknown/unknown), 1500x1495 [SAR 1:1 DAR 300:299], 90k tbr, 90k tbn, 90k tbc (attached pic)
    Metadata:
      comment         : Cover (front)
#+END_EXAMPLE

**** Content of kodi.log
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
ffmpeg[7F6567015700]: [mp3float] Could not update timestamps for skipped samples.
SeekTime - seek ended up on time 0
#+END_EXAMPLE

The solution is to romove the audio file from your BGM playlist. If you have chosen a directory in slideshow-BGM settings, edit '~BGM.m3u~' file in ~script.slideshow-BGM~ directory(folder) under [[https://kodi.wiki/view/Userdata#addon_data][addon_data folder]].
